       " Document(page_content='I will then shift focus to the warehouse optimization example discussedabove.\\nThe history of Graph Theory\\nThe basic idea of graphs were Ô¨Årst introduced in the 18th century by the\\nSwiss mathematician\\xa0 Leonhard Euler , one of the most eminent\\nmathematicians of the 18th century (and of all time, really). His work on\\nthe famous ‚Äú Seven Bridges of K√∂nigsberg problem ‚Äù, are commonly\\nquoted as origin of\\xa0 graph theory .\\nThe city of K√∂nigsberg in Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia) was set on\\nboth sides of the Pregel River, and included two large islands ‚Äî\\nKneiphof and Lomse ‚Äî which were connected to each other, or to the\\ntwo mainland portions of the city, by seven bridges (as illustrated in the\\nbelow Ô¨Ågure to the left). The problem was to devise a walk through the\\ncity that would cross each of those bridges once and only once.\\nEuler, recognizing that the relevant constraints were the four bodies of\\nland & the seven bridges, drew out the Ô¨Årst known visual representation\\nof a modern graph. A modern graph, as seen in bottom-right image, is\\nrepresented by a set of points, known as\\xa0vertices or nodes, connected by\\na set of lines known as edges.\\nThis abstraction from a concrete problem concerning a city and bridges\\netc. to a graph makes the problem tractable mathematically, as this\\nabstract representation includes only the information important for\\nsolving the problem. Euler actually proved that this speciÔ¨Åc problem has\\nno solution. However, the diÔ¨Éculty he faced was the\\xa0 development of a\\nsuitable technique of analysis , and of subsequent tests that\\nestablished this assertion with mathematical rigor. From there, the\\nbranch of math known as graph theory lay dormant for decades. In\\nmodern times, however, it‚Äôs applications are Ô¨Ånally exploding.\\nIntroduction to Graph Theory\\nAs mentioned previously, I do not aim to give a comprehensive\\nintroduction to graph theory. The following section still contains some\\nof the basics when it comes to diÔ¨Äerent kind of graphs etc., which is of\\nrelevance to the example we will discuss later on path optimization.\\nGraph Theory \\xa0is ultimately the study of\\xa0relationships. Given a set of\\nnodes & connections, which can abstract anything from city layouts to\\ncomputer data, graph theory provides a helpful tool to quantify &\\nsimplify the many moving parts of dynamic systems. Studying graphs\\nthrough a framework provides answers to many arrangement,\\nnetworking, optimization, matching and operational problems.\\nGraphs can be used to model many types of relations and processes in\\nphysical, biological, social and information systems, and has a wide range\\nof useful applications such as e.g.\\n‚Ä¢ Finding communities in networks, such as social\\nmedia (friend/connection recommendations), or in\\nthe recent days for possible spread of COVID19 in the\\ncommunity through contacts.\\n‚Ä¢ Ranking/ordering hyperlinks in search engines.\\n‚Ä¢ GPS/Google maps to Ô¨Ånd the shortest path home.\\n‚Ä¢ Study of molecules and atoms in chemistry.\\n‚Ä¢ DNA sequencing\\n‚Ä¢ Computer network security\\n‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¶.. and many more‚Ä¶.\\n(2) What is Graph Theory, and why should you care? | ... https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-graph-theory-wh...\\n3 of 10 5/27/24, 22:07', metadata={'source': 'grafo.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

The one we\\nhave in this example is an undirected weighted graph. The cost (or distance)\\nfrom the green to the orange node (and vice versa) is 3. Like our previous\\nexample, if you want to travel between two cities, say city green and\\norange, we would have to drive 3 miles. These metrics are self-deÔ¨Åned and\\ncould be changed according to the situations. For a more elaborated\\nexample, consider you have to travel to city pink from green. If you look at\\nthe city graph, we can‚Äôt Ô¨Ånd any direct roads or edges between the two\\ncities. So what we can do is to travel via another city. The most promising\\nroutes would be starting from green to pink via orange and blue. If the\\nweights are costs between cities, we would have to spend 11$ to travel via\\nblue to reach pink but if we take the other route via orange, we would only\\nhave to pay 10$ for the trip.\\nThere may be several weights associated with each edge, including\\ndistance, travel time, or monetary cost. Such weighted graphs are\\ncommonly used to program GPS‚Äôs, and travel-planning search engines that\\ncompare Ô¨Çight times and costs.\\nGraph Theory ‚Üí Route optimization\\nHaving (hopefully) convinced you that graph theory is worth knowing\\nsomething about, it is now time to focus on our example case of route\\nplanning when picking items in our warehouse.\\nChallenge:\\nThe challenge here is that given a ‚Äúpicking list‚Äù as input, we should Ô¨Ånd\\nthe shortest route that passes all the pickup points, but also complies to\\nthe restrictions with regard to where it is possible/allowed to drive. The\\nassumptions and constraints here are that crossing between corridors in\\nthe warehouse is only allowed at marked ‚Äúturning points‚Äù. Also, the\\ndirection of travel must follow the speciÔ¨Åed legal driving direction for\\neach corridor.\\nSolution:\\nThis problem can be formulated as an optimization problem in graph\\ntheory.\\nAll pickup points in the warehouse form a ‚Äúnode‚Äù in the graph, where the\\nedges represent permitted lanes/corridors and distances between the\\nnodes. To introduce the problem more formally, let us start from a\\nsimpliÔ¨Åed example.\\nThe graph below represents 2 corridors with 5 shelves/pickup-points per\\ncorridor. All shelves are here represented as a node in the graph, with an\\naddress ranging from 1‚Äì10. The arrows indicate the permitted driving\\ndirection, where the double arrows indicate that you can drive either\\nway. Simple enough, right?\\nBeing able to represent the permitted driving routes in the form of a\\ngraph, means that we can use mathematical techniques known fromgraph theory to Ô¨Ånd the optimal ‚Äúdriving route‚Äù between the nodes (i.e.,\\n(2) What is Graph Theory, and why should you care? | ... https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-graph-theory-wh...\\n5 of 10 5/27/24, 22:07', metadata={'source': 'grafo.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",

These\\nstatistics can then also be Ô¨Åltered on various information such as item\\ntype, customer, date, etc. In the following section, I have thus picked a\\nfew examples on how one can extract interesting statistics from such a\\npath optimization tool.\\nIn doing this, I Ô¨Årst generated 10.000 picking order lists where the\\nnumber of items per list ranges from 1‚Äì30 items, located at random\\npickup points in the warehouse (address 3‚Äì74 in the Ô¨Ågure above). By\\nperforming the path optimization procedure over all these picking list,\\nwe can then extract some interesting statistics.\\nExample 1:\\xa0 Calculate mileage as a function of the number of units per.\\npicking order list. Here, you would naturally assume that the total\\nmileage increases the more items you have to pick. But, at some level,\\nthis will start to Ô¨Çatten out. This is due to the fact that one eventually\\nhas to stop by all the corridors in the warehouse to pick up goods, which\\nthen prevents us from making use of clever ‚Äúshortcuts‚Äù to minimize the\\ntotal driving distance. This tendency can be illustrated in the Ô¨Ågure\\nbelow to the left, which illustrates that for more than approximately 15‚Äì\\n20 units per picking order, adding extra items does not make the total\\nmileage much longer (as you have to drive through all corridors of the\\nwarehouse anyway). Note that the Ô¨Ågures show a ‚Äúdensity plot‚Äù of the\\ndistribution of typical mileage per. picking orders list\\nAnother interesting statistic, which shows the same trend, is the\\ndistribution of driving distance per picked item in the Ô¨Ågure to the right.\\nHere, we see that for picking lists with few items, the typical mileage\\nper. item is relatively high (with a large variance, depending on how\\n‚Äúlucky‚Äù we are with some items being located in the same corridor etc.).\\nFor picking lists with several items though, the mileage per. item is\\ngradually decreasing. This type of statistic can thus be interesting to\\ninvestigate closer, in order to optimize how many items each picking\\norder list should contain in order to minimize the mileage per picked\\nitem.\\nExample 2: \\xa0Here I have used real-world data that also contains additional\\ninformation in the form of a customer ID (here shown for only two\\ncustomers). We can then take a closer look at the distribution in mileage\\nper. picking order list for the two customers. For example, do you\\ntypically have to drive longer distances to pick the goods of one\\ncustomer versus another? And, should you charge that customer extra\\nfor this additional cost?\\nThe below Ô¨Ågure to the left shows the distribution in mileage for\\n¬´Customer 1¬ª and ¬´Customer 2¬ª respectively. One of the things we can\\ninterpret from this is that for customer 2, most picking order lists have a\\nnoticeably shorter driving distance compared to customer 1. This can\\nalso be shown by calculating the average mileage per. picking order list\\nfor the two customers (Ô¨Ågure to the right).\\nThis type of information can e.g. be used to implement pricing models\\nwhere the product price to the customer is also based on mileage per\\norder. For customers where the order involves more driving (and thus\\nalso more time and higher cost) you can consider invoicing extra\\ncompared to orders that involve short driving distances.\\nSummary:\\nIn the end, I hope I have convinced you that graph theory is not just some\\nabstract mathematical concept, but that it actually has many useful and\\ninteresting applications!

       " Document(page_content='By providing a list of picking orders as input, one can thus relatively\\neasily calculate statistics on typical mileage per. picking order. These\\nstatistics can then also be Ô¨Åltered on various information such as item\\ntype, customer, date, etc. In the following section, I have thus picked a\\nfew examples on how one can extract interesting statistics from such a\\npath optimization tool.\\nIn doing this, I Ô¨Årst generated 10.000 picking order lists where the\\nnumber of items per list ranges from 1‚Äì30 items, located at random\\npickup points in the warehouse (address 3‚Äì74 in the Ô¨Ågure above). By\\nperforming the path optimization procedure over all these picking list,\\nwe can then extract some interesting statistics.\\nExample 1:\\xa0 Calculate mileage as a function of the number of units per.\\npicking order list. Here, you would naturally assume that the total\\nmileage increases the more items you have to pick. But, at some level,\\nthis will start to Ô¨Çatten out. This is due to the fact that one eventually\\nhas to stop by all the corridors in the warehouse to pick up goods, which\\nthen prevents us from making use of clever ‚Äúshortcuts‚Äù to minimize the\\ntotal driving distance. This tendency can be illustrated in the Ô¨Ågure\\nbelow to the left, which illustrates that for more than approximately 15‚Äì\\n20 units per picking order, adding extra items does not make the total\\nmileage much longer (as you have to drive through all corridors of the\\nwarehouse anyway). Note that the Ô¨Ågures show a ‚Äúdensity plot‚Äù of the\\ndistribution of typical mileage per. picking orders list\\nAnother interesting statistic, which shows the same trend, is the\\ndistribution of driving distance per picked item in the Ô¨Ågure to the right.\\nHere, we see that for picking lists with few items, the typical mileage\\nper. item is relatively high (with a large variance, depending on how\\n‚Äúlucky‚Äù we are with some items being located in the same corridor etc.).\\nFor picking lists with several items though, the mileage per. item is\\ngradually decreasing. This type of statistic can thus be interesting to\\ninvestigate closer, in order to optimize how many items each picking\\norder list should contain in order to minimize the mileage per picked\\nitem.\\nExample 2: \\xa0Here I have used real-world data that also contains additional\\ninformation in the form of a customer ID (here shown for only two\\ncustomers). We can then take a closer look at the distribution in mileage\\nper. picking order list for the two customers. For example, do you\\ntypically have to drive longer distances to pick the goods of one\\ncustomer versus another? And, should you charge that customer extra\\nfor this additional cost?\\nThe below Ô¨Ågure to the left shows the distribution in mileage for\\n¬´Customer 1¬ª and ¬´Customer 2¬ª respectively. One of the things we can\\ninterpret from this is that for customer 2, most picking order lists have a\\nnoticeably shorter driving distance compared to customer 1. This can\\nalso be shown by calculating the average mileage per. picking order list\\nfor the two customers (Ô¨Ågure to the right).\\nThis type of information can e.g. be used to implement pricing models\\nwhere the product price to the customer is also based on mileage per\\norder. For customers where the order involves more driving (and thus\\nalso more time and higher cost) you can consider invoicing extra\\ncompared to orders that involve short driving distances.\\nSummary:\\nIn the end, I hope I have convinced you that graph theory is not just some\\nabstract mathematical concept, but that it actually has many useful and\\ninteresting applications! Hopefully, the examples above will be useful forsome of you in solving similar problems later, or at least satisfy some of\\n(2) What is Graph Theory, and why should you care? | ... https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-graph-theory-wh...\\n8 of 10 5/27/24, 22:07', metadata={'source': 'grafo.pdf', 'page': 7}),\n",

The idea is\\nrather that through this graph representation, we can now use the\\nmathematical framework and algorithms from graph theory to solve it!\\nSince graph optimization is a well-known Ô¨Åeld in mathematics, there are\\nseveral methods and algorithms that can solve this type of problem.

      "Question: What types of graphs the article mention\n",
      "Answer: The article mentions several types of graphs, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Undirected Graphs: In this type of graph, there is no direction associated with the edges, and nodes can be reached from any other node without any orientation.\n",
      "2. Directed Graphs (DiGraphs): Unlike undirected graphs, directed graphs have orientation or direction among different nodes. Edges show the bidirectional roads.\n",
      "3. Weighted Graphs: Many graphs can have edges containing a weight associated to represent a real-world implication such as cost, distance, quantity etc‚Ä¶ These weighted graphs are commonly used to program GPS‚Äôs and travel-planning search engines that compare flight times and costs.\n",
      "4. Routing Graphs: This problem can be formulated as an optimization problem in graph theory. All pickup points in the warehouse form a ‚Äúnode‚Äù in the graph, where the edges represent permitted lanes/corridors and distances between the nodes. Simple enough, right? Being able to represent the permitted driving routes in the form of a graph means that we can use mathematical techniques known from graph theory to find the optimal ‚Äúdriving route‚Äù between the nodes (i.e., the shortest route that passes all the pickup points but also complies to the restrictions with regard to where it is possible/allowed to drive).\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What's the traveling salesman problem?\n",
      "Answer: The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is a classic problem in combinatorial optimization and operations research that involves finding the shortest possible route that visits a set of cities and returns to the starting city. It is an NP-hard problem, which means that the running time of algorithms for solving TSP increases rapidly as the size of the input increases.\n",
      "\n",
      "In TSP, we are given a set of cities and their pairwise distances, and the task is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city. The problem can be formulated in various ways, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Graph-based formulation: Represent the cities as vertices in a weighted graph, where each edge represents the distance between two cities. The goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex.\n",
      "2. Matrix-based formulation: Represent the cities as integers in a matrix, where the entries in the matrix represent the distances between adjacent cities. The goal is to find the shortest possible row (or column) sum that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city.\n",
      "3. Linear programming formulation: Represent the cities as variables, and use linear programming techniques to find the optimal solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "The traveling salesman problem has many applications in real-world scenarios, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Logistics and transportation planning: TSP can be used to optimize routes for delivery trucks, taxis, or any other vehicle that needs to visit a set of locations.\n",
      "2. Telecommunications network design: TSP can be used to optimize the placement of telecommunications towers or other network infrastructure to minimize the total distance traveled.\n",
      "3. VLSI design: TSP can be used to optimize the placement of components on an integrated circuit chip to minimize the total distance traveled between components.\n",
      "4. Genomics: TSP can be used to optimize the sequencing of DNA samples to minimize the total distance traveled between genomic locations.\n",
      "5. Data compression: TSP can be used to optimize the placement of data bits in a compressed data stream to minimize the total distance traveled between data points.\n",
      "\n",
      "The traveling salesman problem is known to be NP-hard, which means that there is no known polynomial-time algorithm for solving TSP exactly for large instances. However, heuristics and approximation algorithms can be used to find good approximations of the optimal solution in reasonable time.\n",

       "['The article mentions several types of graphs, including:\\n\\n1. Undirected Graphs: A graph where there is no direction associated with edges. Each node can be reached from any other node without any orientation or direction.\\n2. Directed Graphs (DiGraphs): A graph where the orientation or direction of edges is specified. There is a beginning and end to each edge, and you can move only in one direction.\\n3. Weighted Graphs: A graph where each edge has a weight or cost associated with it. These graphs are commonly used to program GPS\\'s and travel-planning search engines that compare flight times and costs.\\n4. Shortest Route Graph Theory: This problem can be formulated as an optimization problem in graph theory, where all pickup points in the warehouse form a \"node\" in the graph, with edges representing permitted lanes/corridors and distances between the nodes.',\n",
       " 'The traveling salesman problem is a classic problem in combinatorial optimization and operations research that involves finding the shortest possible route that visits a set of cities and returns to the starting city. It is a well-known example of a NP-hard problem, which means that there is no known polynomial-time algorithm for solving it exactly for large instances unless P=NP.\\n\\nThe problem can be defined as follows: given a set of cities {(x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xn, yn)} and their pairwise distances {d1 = distance(x1, y1, x2, y2), d2 = distance(x1, y1, x2, y2), ..., dn = distance(xn, yn, xm, ym)}, find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city. The distance matrix {d1, d2, ..., dn} is sometimes called the \"edge weight\" or \"distance matrix\" of the problem.\\n\\nThe traveling salesman problem has many applications in real-world logistics, transportation, and supply chain management, such as designing routes for delivery trucks, scheduling flights for airlines, or planning supply chain networks for companies. It is also an important benchmark problem for testing the performance of algorithms for solving combinatorial optimization problems.\\n\\nThere are several approaches to solve the traveling salesman problem, including exact methods (e.g., branch and bound), heuristics (e.g., nearest neighbor, genetic algorithms), and approximate methods (e.g., linear programming relaxations of the integer programming formulation). The choice of approach depends on the size and complexity of the problem instance, as well as the desired level of accuracy and computational efficiency.',\n",
       " \"There are several methods that can be used to solve the warehouse optimization problem, including:\\n\\n1. Breadth-first search (BFS): This is a simple algorithm that explores all possible routes from the starting point and selects the shortest path. While this method is efficient in terms of time complexity, it may not always find the optimal solution due to its greedy nature.\\n2. Depth-first search (DFS): Similar to BFS, DFS also explores all possible routes but does so by depth-first search instead of breadth-first search. DFS is more likely to find an optimal solution than BFS but may take longer to converge.\\n3. Dijkstra's algorithm: This algorithm is designed to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It works by iteratively relaxing the distance bound and updating the distance of each node until the destination node is reached. While it can find the optimal solution, it may not be efficient for large graphs.\\n4. Bellman-Ford algorithm: This algorithm is similar to Dijkstra's algorithm but can handle negative weight edges. It works by iteratively relaxing the distance bound and updating the distance of each node until the destination node is reached. While it can find the optimal solution, it may not be efficient for large graphs.\\n5. Genetic algorithms: These are a class of optimization algorithms that use principles of natural selection and genetics to search for an optimal solution. They work by generating a population of candidate solutions and iteratively improving them through crossover and mutation operations until the optimal solution is found. While they can find optimal solutions, they may be slower than other methods and require more computational resources.\\n6. Ant colony optimization: This algorithm is inspired by the behavior of ants searching for food. It works by simulating the behavior of ants as they deposit and follow pheromone trails to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph. While it can find optimal solutions, it may be slower than other methods and require more computational resources.\\n7. Simulated Annealing: This algorithm is inspired by the process of annealing in metallurgy, where a material is heated and then cooled slowly to remove defects. It works by iteratively relaxing the distance bound and updating the distance of each node until the destination node is reached. While it can find optimal solutions, it may be slower than other methods and require more computational resources.\\n8. Particle Swarm Optimization: This algorithm is inspired by the behavior of birds flocking together to find food. It works by simulating the behavior of particles as they move through a graph and adjust their positions based on the positions of nearby particles. While it can find optimal solutions, it may be slower than other methods and require more computational resources.\\n9. Hybrid algorithms: These are algorithms that combine two or more of the above methods to solve the problem. For example, a hybrid algorithm might use BFS to explore the graph and then use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path within each explored region. While they can find optimal solutions, they may be slower than other methods and require more computational resources.\\n10. Machine learning algorithms: These are algorithms that use machine learning techniques such as neural networks or support vector machines to solve optimization problems. They work by training a model on a dataset of examples and then using the trained model to make predictions about the optimal solution. While they can find optimal solutions, they may be slower than other methods and require more computational resources.\\n\\nIn conclusion, there are many algorithms that can solve the warehouse optimization problem, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The choice of algorithm will depend on the specific characteristics of the problem, such as the size of the graph, the number of items to be picked up, and the allowed travel distance within the warehouse.\"]"
